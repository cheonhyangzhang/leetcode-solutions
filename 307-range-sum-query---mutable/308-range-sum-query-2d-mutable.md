# 308 Range Sum Query 2D - Mutable

### Problem:
Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
![](/assets/range_sum_query_2d.png)

The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

Example:
```
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]

sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
update(3, 2, 2)
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 10
```

Note:
The matrix is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRegion function is distributed evenly.
You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.
