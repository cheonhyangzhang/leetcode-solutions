# 549 Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II

### Problem:
Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

Example 1:
```
Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
        2
       / \
      1   3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
```

Note: All the values of tree nodes are in the range of [-1e7, 1e7].
