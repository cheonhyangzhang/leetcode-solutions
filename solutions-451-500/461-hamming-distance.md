# 461 Hamming Distance

### Problem

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

### Solutions

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int xor = x^y;
        int count = 0;
        while (xor > 0) {
            if ((xor&1) == 1) {
                count ++;
            }
            xor = xor >> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
