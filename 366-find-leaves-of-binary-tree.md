# 366 Find Leaves of Binary Tree

### Problem:

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree 
<pre>
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
</pre>

Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:
1 Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:
<pre>
          1
         / 
        2     
</pre>
     
2 Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
<pre>
          1          
</pre>

3 Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
<pre>
          []         
</pre>


Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].
