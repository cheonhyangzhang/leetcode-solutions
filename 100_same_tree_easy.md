# 100  Same Tree â€“ Easy


### Problem:



Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.


### Thoughts:



Very straight forward to use recursion way to solve.

It could also be done in an iterative way as well

### Solutions:
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (p != null && q != null && p.val == q.val) {
            return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
